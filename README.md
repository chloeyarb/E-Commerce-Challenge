## Description 

This weeks challenge focuses on the back end for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and takes a deep dive into the Node.js app Sequelize. This application takes the initial starter code and 
updates the code to use Sequelize in order to interact with the SQL database. To connect to the database using Sequalize a connection.js is set to include the users MySql login. In the models folder
the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. The API routes consist of get, post, put and delete requests to send and receive data from the server. This application really enhances the 
way a developer can interact with databases.

## Installation

This requires the NPM installation, which will produce the node_module folder. This will allows access to the Express.js, MySQL2, Sequelize, and Dotenv dependancies which were used in this application. 

Please note a .gitignore was used for this project for the node_modules and .env.
